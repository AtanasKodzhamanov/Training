import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Standardize the data
scaler = StandardScaler()
data_standardized = scaler.fit_transform(data)
# In this example, we use the sklearn library to standardize the data in a dataset. We load the data from a CSV file, and then use the StandardScaler() function to standardize the data by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. This is useful if the data contains values with different scales, which can make it difficult to compare or analyze the data effectively.
