To create a graph to visualize the total spending by each customer, we can use data visualization techniques to plot the data. Here's an example of how we can use Python and the matplotlib library to do this:

python
Copy code

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Group the data by customer id and sum the item prices
total_spending = data.groupby('customer_id')['item_price'].sum()

# Create a bar chart of the total spending
plt.bar(total_spending.index, total_spending.values)

# Set the axis labels and title
plt.xlabel('Customer ID')
plt.ylabel('Total Spending')
plt.title('Total Spending by Customer')

# Display the graph
plt.show()
In this example, we first load the data into a pandas DataFrame using the read_csv() function. We then use the groupby() function to group the data by customer id and sum the item prices for each customer.

Next, we use the bar() function from the matplotlib library to create a bar chart of the total spending by each customer. We use the index and values from the total spending DataFrame as the x and y values for the chart.

Finally, we use the xlabel(), ylabel(), and title() functions to set the axis labels and title for the graph, and the show() function to display the graph.

This is just one example of how data visualization can be used to create graphical representations of data using Python and the matplotlib library. There are many other techniques and libraries available for data visualization in Python, including the seaborn library and the plotly library.
