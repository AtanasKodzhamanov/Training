# compared to Java in Python you can inherit from multiple classes
# Examples:
# Inherit a propery from shape. Extend the shape class with sides. Override the area method.
# Person has name and eats(). Teacher inherits all from person but also teach(). Student inherits all from person but also study().

# issubclass() and isinstance() are built in functions that can be used to check if a class is a subclass of another class or if an object is an instance of a class.
